This project revolves around the current transition from ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) to EV (Electric Vehicles).  We will provide a web application that provides tools that will help users gain information about electric vehicles as well as presenting which EVs are currently available, as well as soon to be available.

This project will be MVC based and will include Java, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.
